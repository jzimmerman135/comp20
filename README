A case study for using xml would be to get user data from a site.
For example on canvas it could monitor what pages have been looked at by
students, along with student information that would be necessary to store.

It reminds me a lot of OOP in C++ and that seems valuable and something that is
missing in html. I find it really easy to think in terms of OOP so I do like
xml, I would like to get to know it better though.
